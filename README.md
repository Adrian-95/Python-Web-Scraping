# Python Web Scraping Project with BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup is a powerful Python library used for scraping data out of HTML, XML and other markup languages. In this project, it is used to scrape data from IMDb and display the oscar-winning movies for every year since 2000. 

Besides the movie title, we are also scraping a short description, the genre and the runtime. The data is then stored in individual text files for each year within the data folder.
